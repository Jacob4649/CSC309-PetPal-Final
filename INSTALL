--- Preparation Section

Below are the following steps to get the project running on your local machine.
Note: you do not have to install anything manually, we have provided scripts that do all the necessary installs.

Open the terminal
cd into the /backend directory in the project folder
Run: `bash startup.sh`
Then run: `bash run.sh`
Open a new terminal window
cd into the /frontend directory in the project folder
Run `npm run start`

--- Deployment Instructions & Environment

Deployment is semi-automated with Google-Cloud-Platform. A Github Actions CI/CD pipeline is used to build the frontend and deploy it to Firebase hosting on pushes to the main branch of the repo. The backend is hosted on an E2-medium compute instance on GCP. The instance runs Debian 11.

---Requirements
All the requirements of our project can be found in the requirements.txt file in the /backend directory in the project folder.
